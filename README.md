# Girls Frontline 2: Exilium Simulator
The Chinese anime girl version of XCOM. Hence the name. Simulator so I can plan out things easily. Simple as that. Except it's not.

Pure HTML, CSS, JS. Though I might use Next.js. You know what to do if you want to try this.

## Features
- 10x10 grid map.
- Obstacles that cannot be traversed.
- Add unit & Remove unit.
- Unit movement system. Limited to 3 tiles. Highlights tiles that can be traversed.
- Turn based system. Next turn triggered after every unit moves.
- Enemy. Moves 1 tile closer to any unit every turn. 
- Map builder. Add and remove enemy/unit/obstacle tile anywhere.
- Map can be exported/imported using JSON.
