# Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium Simulator
A simple simulator for planning strategies in **Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium**.

This project is built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Just open `index.html` to run the simulator. The primary goal of this project is to help me learn JavaScript, so development will continue as long as there's more to explore.
