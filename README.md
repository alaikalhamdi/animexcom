# Girls Frontline 2: Exilium Simulator
The Chinese anime girl version of XCOM. Hence the name. Simulator so I can plan out things easily. Simple as that. Except it's not.

Pure HTML, CSS, JS. Just run `index.html` if you want to try. This project is made to teach myself some Javascript. So high chance this will keep going until I don't have anything to learn.

## Features
### Map Building
- 10x10 grid map. Can be resized using the map builder feature.
- Map builder. Add and remove enemy/unit/obstacle tile anywhere.
- Obstacles that cannot be traversed. Unit pathfinding cannot go through an obstacle if it does not have enough movement points.
- Full covers & partial covers. Both counts as obstacles.
- Map can be exported/imported using JSON.

### Combat & Movement
- Add unit at a designated spawn point.
- Unit movement system. Highlights tiles that can be traversed. Refined movement system that detects obstacles.
- Turn based system. Next turn triggered after every unit moves.
- Click to shoot enemies. Simple. Range is 2 tiles.
- Enemy. Moves 1 tile closer to any unit every turn. 
- Enemy will hit unit if close (1 tile).
- Covers reduces damage if target is in the other side of the target. 

## Contributing
DM `yuantaiga` on Discord if you have any complaints or suggestions. Or issues tab alone will suffice. Want to contribute directly? I will make a projects tab, so if it's already there you may check some issues / suggestions you'd like to work on. 

Also, if you're an artist, you can help me with drawing some GFL2 characters icons! Just DM me if you're interested.

I also would need help on documenting character skills, keys, dupes, etc. But I'm still experimenting with the basics, so it will need to wait, you can still help me write it though.
